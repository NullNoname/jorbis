# JOrbis - Pure Java Ogg Vorbis Decoder
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/NullNoname/jorbis.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#NullNoname/jorbis)

The original README file is available as 'README.original' in the root directory.

This repository is an unofficial mirror of [JOrbis](http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/), a pure Java Ogg Vorbis decoder.
It is mostly the same as the one in [Maven Central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jcraft/jorbis/0.0.17), but this one requires Java 1.6. My unofficial mirror should be compatible with Java 1.3.
